Notes
=====

A final Project submitted in psuedocode for Amit Ray's Free and Open Source Culture class Fall 2014

## Installation

### Setting up your environment

Before you can do anything with this you need to realize it is not actual code; it is just written to look like it. This will not compile. 
No Code is necessary to run at the command prompt and no special things are meant to be downloaded and installed

#### On Windows

I took notes for this class in plaintext, which means that you might not be able to read them in microsoft word, although "Notepad" should work just fine.

To open Notepad click "Start" or the windows symbol in the bottom left, then "Programs", "Accessories", and then "Notepad."

#### On Mac OS X

I wrote the note files in plaintext, but you could probably open them in microsoft word, or pages. Regardless, I recommend opening the document editing program first, and then going to "File"->"open document".
However, it's easy and cool to open this from the terminal window. Terminal should be in "Applications"

Entering "pwd" will tell you were you currently are
Entering "ls" will show you your current folder contents 
Entering "cd" followed by a space and name will take you to that folder 
Entering "cd .." will take you up a folder
Entering "cat" followed by a space and file will print out the file contents 
The files might be long, you might have to scroll up and down to see them all.

#### On Linux

Open the terminal (If you're using linux you should know how to do that)
All the above commands will work to show you the files and their contents.

#### Online

they will also be available to read at Github at this URL:

Reading/Commentary
------------------

I recommend you read all of them. The notes are filled with everything I wrote down in class, be it paraphrasing something you or someone else said, a direct quote from you, a quote you reminded me of, some random thought I had, or things I just wanted to remember. Unfortunately I could not doodle in the digital margins. The "main.cpp" file is written using proper syntax in c++, but in a way to be understood in a silly way. The point of why I am submitting this all as if it were code, is because of how I think it represents most of the problems of this black box society. People don't read the code to open programs on their computer any more than they look under the hood of their own car before turning it on, check their account balance before swiping a debit card, or the contents of their clothing before putting them on. I can tell you that I am a Computer Science major, yet I have never, and probably will never, see the code that runs Microsoft word, Google Chrome, Windows, or any apple app. The reason for this isn't because I won't understand it, but rather because I am not supposed to. If you have any difficulty in opening the files I've submitted here, you (and I suppose your computer) are just proving my point. As a result, I've impressed countless people just by trying to describe what I plan on doing for a living just because they were never exposed to the field at all. 

Secondly, I'm submitting all my notes to show you, the professor, my take on the class through what I've taken from the class. The notes are my understanding of what was being taught combined with my thoughts, concerns, and feelings about it all. You did walk around the room occaisionally while you talked, and possiblly caught glimpses of what people wrote or typed, but I bet you don't often get to see the full unedited rawness of what they've written down. Speaking of rawness, I apologize for any typos or grammatical errors; I'm typing this in "vim", a code editor I used to take notes in the class because of it's shortcuts and ease of moving around the screen through commands. I wanted to increase the level of transparency between what you've taught us and what you can tell I've kept from the course. Many times my notes just sit forever in an old notebook in the back of my room, but finally I have a good reason to share them with you. 

Lastly, I've included the short story called "remembering the 11th" so that you can understand what I wasn't ready to talk to you about. The day I walked with you to your office talking about something being difficult to discuss, I had that story in mind. Though you have countless times showed us the benefits of keeping up with current events, pressing on issues outside the bubble that is RIT, and imploring us to be more politically active; there are somethings that are very difficult to take in and understand. You've brought up september 11th many times, and called us out on not knowing very much about it. However, you should know I am currently a 5th year student, and I was only 9 years old when it happened. I'm not trying to call you old, but rather just to have you understand how few of us students at RIT will continue to remember it. In my case though, I grew up in New York City, and it isn't just a news story for me. I don't mean to claim more from the event then I should, but it was still traumatic, and did affect me on some level. The rest I leave up to you to take how you will.
