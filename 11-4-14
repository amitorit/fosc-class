Questions for Molly Sauter:
    In comparing the DDoS actions of groups like Anonymous to the sit-ins and civil rights acts of the 1960s, you detailed a sort of naivite in the actions of the former. You said that their actions, though trying to show the freedom of the internet by nonviolently retorting against their persecutors, it was not quite as guided as those of the more educated counterparts. I say that the whole reason that those attacks were effective at all was because no one is truly educated in the complexities and capabilities of the internet. As a computer science major, I know that the attacks were nothing more than filling up the bandwitdh of a site so that no one can use it - just like taking up all the seats in a restaurant. However, Simply due to the fact that it involves computers and things being changed by an anonymous outside source, the media can tell as story about it involving the words "Hacking" or "unkown assailants", which would cause anyone who doesn't have technical know-how to be afraid. This connects to what you spoke about in chapter three about the word "Hacker" as a kind of folk-devil who can punish with omni-presence due to no one really knowing the limits of his powers.

        -her work got referenced more frequently because no one else wrote

        -civil rights movement was in effect for many years before MLK

        -the peaceful protestors and the radical separatists complement each other to create a dichotomy allowing for different views on same topic
