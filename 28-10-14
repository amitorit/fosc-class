Hackathons, Participatory culture, and activity within this course
    if we could plug into, program, build, write, individually or together, somthing that we could look back at; it'd be a great provocation
    The Simpsons - approximately approaching as an academic analysis
    That's the student - the one who can be a software engineer, yet also know about feminist politics; the branching of subjects and the understanding of either, both, and how the concepts can intertwine context each other
    Final project shouldn't be a project that you turn in and forever walk away from
        getting the A is the easy part
        it should be something you can build off of
        Learning and Teaching go hand in hand with one another
        There's so much out there, we've all just found only one small part of what it means to be thinking and building in this creative age
        Fold out paintings with as quotes/essays underneath explanations
            example of a final project
            wax paper hiding the paintings with the text printed atop them
            text about a book that what written by someone about breaking barriers in social society - the battle against ignorance/prejudice
        Fog of Freedom - beginnings of a project but cuts off abruptly
        Maybe I could do mathematical analysis of recursive publics and circle-jerk ideas? unraveling the recursion to see the actual progressions

Fog of Freedom
    Are Computers libertarians?
        they should be; they were created by us to do whatever we want
        autonomous freedom to manipulate whatever data and actors out there
        what do we do with all of this? - the tireless technoslave
    Freedom & Constraint
        two halves of the same coin
        one doesn't feel they are being constrained as they are
        is it a freedom to or from to have to get the new techno-gizmo?

    At a time when technological shifts happen so rapidly
        how do we hold on to what makes sense?

        renaissance of ideas and collections being refreshed upon the new
    Achieving the freedoms of others not quite like us - prejudice
    Printing technology
        information that can be replicated and transmitted regularly helped to develop literacy
        the people who were reading no longer read the traditional languages of what they were reading, but rather reading the common spoken language
        In two weeks everyone in germany had seen the 99 theses
            replication among printing presses
            transmitted by mouth among travelers at ~15mph
            messengers spread the message as far as they could
    Command lines not the lingua franca to be readily used by all
        not even for cs users to begin with
        before learning what is used, we have to change the old
        learning to write and speak latin or calculate math without zeroes

"Even having an Affrican-American president does little to change the racism of the age; despite having one upon whom so much as been projected; the ignorance and prejudice is not accepted, merely tolerated."
