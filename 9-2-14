Everything is first and foremost a business
Technology is always getting faster, smaller, cheaper --
    faster, smaller, or cheaper than what? 
    why improve?
    this year we put a 12 on the box

Matthew Kirschenbaum has written books on digital forensics
what happens when we begin to have digital processes replacing original traditions?
    __"Mechanisms"__
    we used to write on vellum - scraped and softened skins
    manuscripts from older than 1550 - an expensive book 
    books still last longer than hard drive - maybe 75 years
    crazy expensive books, saying that cheaper to erase books than make new ones
    knowledge did still get erased and rewritten like hard drives
    xray revealed the impressions of books or the details of old paintings
        one can now tell what work was done by masters vs apprentices
        finding new hidden works that weren't there before
        new technologies reveal more about the old

how can you have a public without a history?
    history is never fixed
    every generation must go back and re-interpret the past
    complacence and being complicit not necessarily by realization because new history and technologies keep coming out faster and faster
    time being the only way to measure and take steps back from things
    years seem to be shorter as we get older - measurements of time are less of the total whole that is the age of our lives
    
In 1990, given the data and programs that we are using - what do we gain and what do we lose as we upgrade our information - backwards compatability?
    translation processes always have error and loss
    to this day we don't really have a robust way of dealing with these issues
    what remains on the old technology and floppy disks?
    what treasures could still be out there that never upgraded along with everything else

Matthew Fuller's histories of use
Engineering, programming, philosphical, writer to best understand fusions
"Virtuoso" words usable now that the topics have been blended

Objects
    what they mean, what they're capable of
    cargo ships full of objects bring them places
    planet money makes a t-shirt & the story of stuff
    how things and people come together
    where and why do all these things come together to be bought and sold?
    the inventor of the system of cargo ships and their efficiency changed the world, but died recently, and no one knows his name
    ships haven't gotten faster since the 50's, but more efficient

The idea of the author - that I am the source from which the creativity eminates, and that I can monetize that creativity is a very recent concept
    going from indie to huge corporation
    at what point does the little guy become the man?
    scaling and how you stop people from reaching your level to maintain it

Jason Scott - chief archivist at the internet archive
    recording the past of the last 50 years
    expertise in changes in computer capability and technological progress
